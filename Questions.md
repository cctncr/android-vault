- What is a use case for using a ContentProvider to initialize resources or configurations when an app starts?
- How to handle configuration changes? [[Handling Configuration Change]]
- What are the dif erent strategies for handling configuration changes, and how does the ViewModel help in preserving UI-related data during such events?
-  How does the android:configChanges attribute in AndroidManifest affect activity lifecycle behavior, and in what scenarios should onConfigurationChanged() method be used instead of relying on activity recreation?
